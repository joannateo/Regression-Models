####Regression Models Quiz 1


######Question 1
Consider the data set given below

x <- c(0.18, -1.54, 0.42, 0.95)
And weights given by

w <- c(2, 1, 3, 1)
Give the value of μ that minimizes the least squares equation ∑ni=1wi(xi−μ)2

> x <- c(0.18, -1.54, 0.42, 0.95)
> w <- c(2, 1, 3, 1)
> optimize( function(u){ sum(w*(x-u)^2) }, interval=c(-100,100))
$minimum
[1] 0.1471429

$objective
[1] 3.716543

Plotting it out
obj <- function(U){sapply(U, function(u) sum(w*(x-u)^2))}
curve(obj, from=-2, to=2)


######Question 2
Consider the following data set

x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)
y <- c(1.39, 0.72, 1.55, 0.48, 1.19, -1.59, 1.23, -0.65, 1.49, 0.05)
Fit the regression through the origin and get the slope treating y as the outcome and x as the regressor. (Hint, do not center the data since we want regression through the origin, not through the means of the data.)

> x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)
> y <- c(1.39, 0.72, 1.55, 0.48, 1.19, -1.59, 1.23, -0.65, 1.49, 0.05)
> fit.origin <- lm( y ~ x - 1 )
> summary(fit.origin)

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x - 1)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-2.0692 -0.2536  0.5303  0.8592  1.1286 

Coefficients:

x   0.8263     0.5817   1.421    0.189

Residual standard error: 1.094 on 9 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.1831,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.09238 
F-statistic: 2.018 on 1 and 9 DF,  p-value: 0.1892

Answer: 0.8263

######Question 3
Do data(mtcars) from the datasets package and fit the regression model with mpg as the outcome and weight as the predictor. Give the slope coefficient.

> data(mtcars)
> fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
> summary(fit)

Call:
lm(formula = mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-4.5432 -2.3647 -0.1252  1.4096  6.8727 

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)  37.2851     1.8776  19.858  < 2e-16 ***
wt           -5.3445     0.5591  -9.559 1.29e-10 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 3.046 on 30 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7528,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.7446 
F-statistic: 91.38 on 1 and 30 DF,  p-value: 1.294e-10

Slope Coefficient = -5.3445

######Question 4
Consider data with an outcome (Y) and a predictor (X). The standard deviation of the predictor is one half that of the outcome. The correlation between the two variables is .5. What value would the slope coefficient for the regression model with Y as the outcome and X as the predictor?

Cor(X,Y)=1/2
2⋅Sd(X)=Sd(Y)
β^1=Cor(Y,X)SdY/SdX
β^1=1/2(2SdY/SdX)=1/2*2/1

Answer: 1

######Question 5
Students were given two hard tests and scores were normalized to have empirical mean 0 and variance 1. The correlation between the scores on the two tests was 0.4. What would be the expected score on Quiz 2 for a student who had a normalized score of 1.5 on Quiz 1?
Cor(q1,q2)=0.4
Zq1=1.5
> 1.5 *0.4 
[1] 0.6

######Question 6
Consider the data given by the following

x <- c(8.58, 10.46, 9.01, 9.64, 8.86)
What is the value of the first measurement if x were normalized (to have mean 0 and variance 1)?

> x <- c(8.58, 10.46, 9.01, 9.64, 8.86)
> m.x <- mean(x)
> sd.x <- sd(x)
> (x[1] - m.x)/sd.x
[1] -0.9718658

######Question 7
Consider the following data set (used above as well). What is the intercept for fitting the model with x as the predictor and y as the outcome?
> x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)
> y <- c(1.39, 0.72, 1.55, 0.48, 1.19, -1.59, 1.23, -0.65, 1.49, 0.05)
> lm( y ~ x )

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)            x  
      1.567       -1.713  
      

######Question 8
You know that both the predictor and response have mean 0. What can be said about the intercept when you fit a linear regression?
answer: It must be identically 0.

######Question 9
Consider the data given by

x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)
What value minimizes the sum of the squared distances between these points and itself?

> x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)
> mean(x)
[1] 0.573

######Question 10
Consider taking the slope having fit Y as the outcome and X as the predictor, β1 and the slope from fitting X as the outcome and Y as the predictor, γ1, and dividing the two as β1/γ1. What is this ratio always equal to


β1=Cor(X,Y)Sy/SX
γ1=Cor(X,Y)SX/SY
β1/γ1=(Cor(X,Y)Sy/SX)/(Cor(X,Y)SX/SY)
SY/SX*SY/SX=S2Y/S2X=Var(Y)/Var(X)


Answer: Var(Y)/Var(X)
